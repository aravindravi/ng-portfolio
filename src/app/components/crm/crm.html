				<h3>USER RESEARCH</h3>
					<p class="col-md-8">This project proved to be a good example of why design should be a research-driven process. About 70% of the effort was spent on research which led to numerous interesting findings. Assets cannot be shared due to NDA.</p>

					<li class="col-md-4 pad-bottom-40">
						<div class="lnr-holder"><span class="lnr lnr-users2 lnr-lg"></span></div>
						<p class="icon-caption">Interviews</p>
						<p>We conducted interviews with 11 participants. There were multiple rounds of interviews that helped uncover some of the problems faced by the clients. Details cannot be disclosed due to NDA. These interviews helped to gain an indepth understanding of the processes that the clients were following.</p>

					<li class="col-md-4 pad-bottom-40">
						<div class="lnr-holder"><span class="lnr lnr-bubble-question lnr-lg"></span></div>
						<p class="icon-caption">Survey</p>
						<p>We sent out surveys to select people to better understand their problems in the domain we were working on. This was a qualitative survey over a quantitative one with a small sample size. Questions were structured to get more qualitative information to keep it a more exploratory process. It helped discover the problems faced by these people in certain areas that were exploring.</p>

					<li class="col-md-4 pad-bottom-40">
						<div class="lnr-holder"><span class="lnr lnr-binoculars2 lnr-lg"></span></div>
						<p class="icon-caption">Competitive Analysis</p>
						<p>Our team also conducted competitive analysis on products that existed in the market. This was a key strategy in our process as it unearthed several key insights in the domain and take the right product decisions. This also helped us make decisions on certain features of the product.</p>

				<h3>ANALYSIS</h3>

						<div class="lnr-holder"><span class="lnr lnr-site-map lnr-lg"></span></div>
						<p class="icon-caption">Process Modeling</p>
						<p class="gray-box">From the interview data, it was clear that the process followed by the client were too complex to handle at a conceptual level. We modelled it and highlighted key areas that could be automated. This also helped converge on more specific problems and communicate our ideas to the clients.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="col-md-4 pad-bottom-40">
						<div class="lnr-holder"><span class="lnr lnr-papers lnr-lg"></span></div>
						<p class="icon-caption">Affinity Maps</p>
						<p class="gray-box">Our clients spoke about problems, needs, processes and wishlists. The wishlists were not often around what they had initially asked for, or what we had budgeted them for. These had to be carefully categorized and having affinity maps were helpful not just for the design team, but also the clients to have a better picture of their processes.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="col-md-4 pad-bottom-40">
						<div class="lnr-holder"><span class="lnr lnr-archery lnr-lg"></span></div>
						<p class="icon-caption">Strategy</p>
						<p class="gray-box">We explored possibilities of tying into some of the existing products for the clients. We also explored any existing tools they were using for their processes to see if we could integrate with them, or design a product that would be similar to what they were used to - a decision made with the help of Personas.</p>

				<h3>PERSONAS</h3>
				
				<p class="col-md-4">Our personas paved the way for an empathy driven design process. That's not in saying that documenting a persona leads to empathy, but a thoughtful and thorough research process prior to that helped gain a good understanding of the people we were designing for. This helped craft the personas in such a manner that they were instrumental in driving the decision making in the rest of the process.

				<h3>SKETCHES</h3>
				<p class="col-md-4">By the time we finished our research, we were way ahead of our budget and behind timelines. I had very little time remaining but at the same time come up with quality wireframes and prototypes as deliverables for this phase.

				<div class="col-md-4">
					<h4 class="text-center">STEP 1: Concept Sketching</h4>
					<p>Once we had laid out the functional and non-functional requirements, I laid out some concepts with some sketches that covered some of the key features. These were around business strategies for the clients over the actual user interface, such as features, analytics and reports.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-4">
					<h4 class="text-center">STEP 2: UI Flow</h4>
					<p>I created some high level concepts for the user interface and rough sitemaps on the flow of screens. This was a rapid process as I could not afford to iterate much on the wireframes which was the next step. It was worth exploring quite a bit with sketches, a valuable tool indeed.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-4">
					<h4 class="text-center">STEP 3: Mobile-First</h4>
					<p>My sketches first covered the mobile viewport. This was to not just ensure that the responsive designs were feasible, but also in making sure that the experience was consistent and intuitive across platforms. Some of the users had to access this application out on the field and it was crucial to nail this down.</p>
